# Discovery
A repository with various in-progress and/or finished code snippets for discoverygc.com and discoverygc.com/wiki, and an issue tracker for things I need to look into or fix.

- Improves text/background contrast in many locations (e.g. the shoutbox)
- Fixes the user profile dropdown avatar scaling issue
- Fixes progress bar wrapping issues
- Prefills the mod/admin/dev post editing username option with your own username
- Fixes Gecko/Firefox rendering issue where the forum container would disappear outside the viewport
- Makes better use of available viewport space
- Plus some minor layout alignment changes here and there to get things to line up a bit better.
